# BeamerTemplate

想法最早来自统院概率论老师的课件以一种不同于 Power Print 的方式呈现出来，这深深引起了我的好奇。

熟练使用这个模板之后，你会可以发现很多神奇的地方（很多科研工作者、很多老师都在采用这种方式创作）

这里是我通过一些其他模板集合他们的特点整理而成的NKU beamer模板。里面覆盖了大部分常用的类型（公式、三线表格、简易的步骤动画），同时我会把我参考的内容放在下面，里面涵盖的内容比我要全（比如作图等等）
使用的时候，替换里面的内容即可。

里面的NKU.sty是一个较为现成的文件，我只是简单修改了配色和简单的样式，总之不太难

我好像有些功能没有实现（正文的高亮块和高亮部分文字），不过很多功能其实和LaTeX类似，熟练LaTeX语法应该可以玩转Beamer，后面我也会继续添加的。

希望有缘人给我点一个小小的star~🌟⭐哪天我的模板能出现在CCF A类文的答辩现场，我将不胜感激！

The idea originally came from the probability theory courseware of a teacher in the School of Statistics and Data Science, presented in a way different from PowerPoint, which really piqued my curiosity.

After you get proficient in using this template, you'll discover many amazing features. (Many researchers and teachers are using this approach for their creations.)

Here is the NKU Beamer template I compiled by integrating the features of some other templates. It covers most commonly - used types (such as formulas, three - line tables, and simple step - by - step animations). Meanwhile, I'll list the references below. The content in these references is more comprehensive than what's in my template (for example, graphic creation). When using this template, you just need to replace the existing content.

The NKU.sty file is quite ready - made. I only made simple modifications to the color scheme and basic styles. In short, it's not very difficult.

It seems that there are some functions I haven't implemented yet (like highlighted blocks in the main text and highlighted text segments). However, many functions in Beamer are similar to those in LaTeX. If you're familiar with LaTeX syntax, you should be able to handle Beamer with ease. I'll continue to add more features later.

I hope that those who come across this will give me a little star! 🌟⭐ I'd be extremely grateful if one day my template could be used in the defense presentations of CCF A - class papers! (Translate by Doubao AI)
